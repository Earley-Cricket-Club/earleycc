            We are Earley Cricket Club in Reading started in 2007. The club is run by passionate volunteers, we have 50+ members from different age groups, ethnicity, and backgrounds. 
            Our cricket club is not just a sports facility; it's a haven for camaraderie, a breeding ground for talent - some of the kids who started their journey here are playing county level cricket now, 
            and a place where memories are made. We currently run the following teams:<br>
            <p class="text-center">
                <ul>
                    <li>2x Saturday League Teams (BCL)</li>
                    <li>1x Sunday friendly</li>
                    <li>1x Midweek team</li>
                    <li>1x Indoor team</li>
                    <li>We are also starting a women's team from next year (2024).</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h1>Help Us Build A Pavilion</h1>
            <p class="text-center">
                Our club is run by the funds raised through memberships and fundraising events. In the last few years, we invested the money raised on Cricket pitch, nets, lawn mover, roller, pitch covers, shed etc.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center">
                Our club doesn't have a pavilion. When it rains or when its too hot etc. then there is nothing to protect members or spectators from the hot sun or rain apart from shed. This also impacts our club reputation and attracting new talent.            
            </p>
            <p class="text-center">
            <strong>Why a Pavilion?</strong><br>
            <strong>Player Comfort:</strong> A pavilion provides our players with the facilities for changing and spaces to strategize and unwind. It will also improve the reputation of the club and attract new talent.<br>
            <strong>Spectator Experience:</strong> For our supporters, a pavilion means comfortable seating, a place to savour the thrill of the game, and a hub for socializing.<br>
            <strong>Community Hub:</strong> Beyond the game, our pavilion will serve as a community hub for any future fund rising events like soft ball tournaments we have been conducting past few years and activities that strengthen the bonds that make our club a family.
            </p>
