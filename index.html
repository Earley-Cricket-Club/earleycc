                    We are Earley Cricket Club in Reading started in 2007. The club is run by passionate volunteers, we have 40+ members from different age groups, ethnicity, and backgrounds.
                    Our cricket club is not just a sports facility; it's a haven for camaraderie, a breeding ground for talent - some of the kids who started their journey here are playing county level cricket now,
                    and a place where memories are made.

                    Our club is run by the funds raised through memberships and fundraising events. In the last few
                    years, we invested the money raised on Cricket pitch, nets, lawn mover, roller, pitch covers, sheds,
                    pavilion etc but as we look to grow the club we need your support.
